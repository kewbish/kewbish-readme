# Hey - I'm Emilie, though on the web I'm Kewbish.

I'm a software engineer interested in all things distributed systems and HCI. I'm also a gap-year senior studying Honours Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca).

Recently, I've interned at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) on their MongoDB team, saving thousands in AWS costs by automating database assignments; at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) on the Queues team, adding dashboard debugging features; and at [Replit](https://repl.it) on the frontend infrastructure team, working on the IDE experience.

In my research, I've explored areas like distributed systems security, formal verification, network theory, and software engineering. I've worked as a Visiting Researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) on the [Kintsugi project](https://github.com/kewbish/kintsugi), and at UBC, I've worked as an undergraduate research assistant [dcal](https://github.com/DistCompiler/dcal) and [PR-Issue Graph](https://github.com/ubcdlab/pr-issue-topology-project) projects. I'm also inspired by the Internet's potential to empower decentralized creation: the sheer surface area of the Internet means it's a central part of our lives, and I'd like to explore how we can make it better.
